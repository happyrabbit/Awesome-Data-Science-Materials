- `scijava-jupyter-kernel` aims to be a polyglot Jupyter kernel. It uses the Scijava scripting languages to execute the code in Jupyter client and it's possible to use different languages in the same notebook.

Some of the supported languages are Groovy (default), Python, Beanshell, Clojure, Java, Javascript, Ruby and Scala.

- HTML
    - WHATWG: Web Hypertext Application Technology Group
    - W3C: World Wide Web Consortium
    - Resources for validating html:
        - html5 standard (academic type of reading). If you want to kind of know what the actual standard is that everybody agreed to, this is a great document to start with.: https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/
        - The site keeps track of HTML5, SVG, CSS standards, JavaScript APIs etc. It tells you which browser supports what: https://caniuse.com
        - Find out whether or not your HTML actually is going to work in browsers: http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_url
        - Check browser statistics: https://www.w3schools.com/browsers/default.asp
