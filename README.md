# Awesome-Data-Science-Materials

This repository contains a summary of some data science materials: papers, useful packages, MOOC, career development info, etc. 

## Data Science Paper

- [Practical Data Science for Stats - a PeerJ Collection](https://peerj.com/collections/50-practicaldatascistats): Very interesting and insightful papers on data science practice

## SQL Learning

- Dan Jurafsky & Chris Manning: Natural Language Processing: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6397E4B26D00A269

## Experimentation

- 'pwr' package: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pwr/vignettes/pwr-vignette.html

## Tidy Data

- [`broom`](https://github.com/tidyverse/broom) package:  takes the messy output of built-in functions in R, such as lm, nls, or t.test, and turns them into tidy data frames

## Causal Inference

- `CausalTree`

## Data Science Education & Career

- [Industry recommendations for academic data science programs](https://github.com/brohrer/academic_advisory) : The academic advisory document is public and a work in progress. It represents the views of its authors and not necessarily their institutions. It includes collected thoughts on what a data scientist does, and what differentiates an exceptional data scientist. It also includes some ideas about industry-academia partnering and a growing list of industry use cases.

## Others

- Unix Learning Notes: http://scientistcafe.com/notes/Unix/
- `scijava-jupyter-kernel` aims to be a polyglot Jupyter kernel. It uses the Scijava scripting languages to execute the code in Jupyter client and it's possible to use different languages in the same notebook.

Some of the supported languages are Groovy (default), Python, Beanshell, Clojure, Java, Javascript, Ruby and Scala.

## Web Development

- Giraffe Academy (fun and free online programming education): http://www.giraffeacademy.com
- JavaScript Online Editor:
    - https://jsfiddle.net
    - https://codepen.io
- HTML
    - WHATWG: Web Hypertext Application Technology Group
    - W3C: World Wide Web Consortium
    - Resources for validating html:
        - html5 standard (academic type of reading). If you want to kind of know what the actual standard is that everybody agreed to, this is a great document to start with.: https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/
        - The site keeps track of HTML5, SVG, CSS standards, JavaScript APIs etc. It tells you which browser supports what: https://caniuse.com
        - Find out whether or not your HTML actually is going to work in browsers: http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_url
        - Check browser statistics: https://www.w3schools.com/browsers/default.asp
