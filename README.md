# Awesome-Data-Science-Materials

This repository contains a summary of some data science materials: papers, useful packages, MOOC, career development info, etc. 

## Data Science Education & Career

- [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com): Less math and more tutorials with working code.
- [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/): Deep Learning Specialization. It teaches the most important and foundational principles of Deep Learning
- [Introduction to Deep Learning (MIT)](http://introtodeeplearning.com/): It is a high-level introduction course. If you want to learn more details about the building blocks of deep learning, refer to the previous course from deeplearning.ai
- [TensorFlow in Practice](https://www.deeplearning.ai/tensorflow-in-practice/): This Specialization will teach you best practices for using TensorFlow. It is code heavy but doesn't introduce the theoretical background of the models. It is a great companion to Deep Learning Specialization.
- [A Crash Course in Causality](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crash-course-in-causality): Great introduction to causal inference.It provides R code on some example data. 

## Data Science Paper

- [Practical Data Science for Stats - a PeerJ Collection](https://peerj.com/collections/50-practicaldatascistats): Very interesting and insightful papers on data science practice

## Others

- Unix Learning Notes: http://scientistcafe.com/notes/Unix/
- `scijava-jupyter-kernel` aims to be a polyglot Jupyter kernel. It uses the Scijava scripting languages to execute the code in Jupyter client and it's possible to use different languages in the same notebook.

Some of the supported languages are Groovy (default), Python, Beanshell, Clojure, Java, Javascript, Ruby and Scala.

    - Resources for validating html:
        - html5 standard (academic type of reading). If you want to kind of know what the actual standard is that everybody agreed to, this is a great document to start with.: https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/
        - The site keeps track of HTML5, SVG, CSS standards, JavaScript APIs etc. It tells you which browser supports what: https://caniuse.com
        - Find out whether or not your HTML actually is going to work in browsers: http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_url
        - Check browser statistics: https://www.w3schools.com/browsers/default.asp
